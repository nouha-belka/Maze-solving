# Robotic Project - Path Optimization Algorithm

This project is a robotic application developed in C++. The objective of the project is to optimize a given path received from the robot in the form of a string. The path is generated using the LSBR (Left, Straight, Right, Back) method. The optimization algorithm eliminates all dead ends in the path, providing a new string that represents an optimized path. The optimized path allows the robot to navigate directly to the endpoint without unnecessary detours.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to optimize the path generated by the robot using the LSBR method. Dead ends in the path are identified and removed to create an optimized path. This optimization minimizes unnecessary movements and enables the robot to reach the endpoint efficiently.

## Algorithm

The optimization algorithm performs the following steps:

1. Receive the path string from the robot, representing the movements of the robot using the LSBR method. The path may contain characters such as 'L' (left), 'S' (straight), 'R' (right), and 'B' (back).

2. Parse the path string character by character and keep track of the robot's current position and direction.

3. Identify dead ends in the path. Dead ends are encountered when the robot reaches a point where it cannot continue in any direction except to go back (the 'B' movement). 

4. Eliminate the dead ends by removing the corresponding movements from the path string.

5. Generate a new optimized path string that represents the optimized movements for the robot to reach the endpoint directly.


## Example
In the image down bellow the sequence give by the robot ofter LSRB exploration is : SLLLRLLLBRRSRLLRRRLLRLLBSSBLLLRSSRRBLLLLRRLSLLBL

And sequence after dead elimination by the algorithem is : SLLLRRRLLRRRLLRLRRLLRSRLRRLSLS
